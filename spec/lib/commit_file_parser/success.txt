92e643c Tue Feb 21 17:54:31 2012 -0700 Fix for ticket 3460, clicking menu items on user page is fidgety. Removing :active on button_base so that opacity will stay at 100% for click events. This is required because for whatever reason, Chrome will send click events to background elements with higher opacity.
